Currently exploring the data sets, merging them and trying to git rid of duplicates.

- Learned a lot with this work. Got a better sense of making the different types of graphs and how to label them.
- Took time to compare & contrast using matplot or pandas to create graphs. Trying to understand their structure.
- Got a better sense of using pandas to create filtered dataframes. Worked with groupby and aggregating as a shortcut.
- Had some struggle understanding the boxplot section, wasn't very clear what was being asked.
- Finally I was proud of an extra step taken to randomly select a mouse each time for the line plot, interested in allowing a user to input a specified drug their interested in.

Need to still do:
- Double check annotations and cleaniless of the code/presentation.
- Write 3 observations at the top.
